# K.N. Toosi University of Technology JavaFX Workshop 4
In this part we will work in depth with bindings (unidirectional binding and bidirectional binding) and we will explain how Observer Design Pattern works so you can understand bindings better.
For example the text field value and slider value binded bidirectionaly which means if text field value changes or slider value changes it will affect another one. In the other hand, slider value binded unidirectionaly which means only changes in slider value will affect Progress Indicator.
